# Sound Assets

This directory would contain sound files for the game:

1. laser.mp3 - Player shooting sound
2. explosion.mp3 - Enemy explosion sound
3. background.mp3 - Background music
4. gameover.mp3 - Game over sound
5. powerup.mp3 - Power-up collection sound

Due to limitations in generating actual sound files, these are just placeholders for where the actual sound files would go.
